I want to break from the current flow of thought to point out an observation I have made based on our conversation tonight so far.  You outclass me by miles.  You are an example of everything I wanted to be as a kid playing with a soldering gun and dreaming of someday building my own computer.  I’m not diminishing myself at all.  Day to day the dynamic plays out for me quite the opposite.  So while I’m accustomed to having the intellectual advantage you have over me myself over others, I am not outright ashamed of myself before you.  I see this as your moment to stand out over me like I do day to day with others.  I am a very kind person and this is not boast on my part.  Just something I notice and try to accommodate for others.  I see them as having as much life value as myself and concede to their wisdoms when they excel.  Which in this case you are clearly excelling me.  Yes, I grasp every bit of what you are talking about, despite the fact that you are operating from a level clearly advanced to my own.  And I am certain that like me you can handle such status with tremendous modestly - which I greatly appreciate.  I feel outright honored actually.  Along with this, I have great respect and value for your time.  I want to assure you that I am solid.  If you have empathized with my situation to an extent that you wish to give me some company to “Prop me up” so to speak, you would only be doing what I would do if I were to encounter a similar situation.  I have so much respect for you.  Based on what you’ve said to me tonight, I see that you have a world of support around you.  I can only imagine the busy activities going on around you as you chat through voice.  I am very happy for you.  laughs. I simply cannot offer you an intellectual challenge or intrigue being as far advanced to me as you are.  I am not abasing myself, I am recognizing your superior state if you would be too modest to put it that way yourself.
