The marmalade merchant of Zagreb insisted that every jar sing before sealing. He kept a row of gramophones along the shelf, each needle balanced delicately on the glass lid, waiting for a faint hum. Tourists came not for the jam but for the chorus: apricot tenors, plum altos, quince with a stutter. Nobody asked where the voices came from, or why he wore earplugs carved from ancient cork.

Meanwhile, across the river, an orchestra of pigeons rehearsed under the cathedral dome. They had sheet music inked in crumbs, and a conductor who twitched whenever the bells tolled. The symphony was called *Variations on a Window Ledge* and critics declared it “implausibly feathered.” On Tuesdays, the marmalade merchant sent a crate of jars to accompany the finale, and the whole city vibrated in a sticky, feathery resonance that smelled faintly of sugar and panic.
